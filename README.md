Small Unity plugin containing some useful scripts. They can help less development-oriented people to express their ideas. It is a collection of my scripts from many other projects and modified to feedback that I got from colleagues, designers, and other collaborators.

## Installation

The plugin doesn't need any special dependencies or versions of Unity. The only requirement is the Package Manager (Unity 2019.1+).

* Open your Unity project and go to `Window/Package Manager`
* Click the `+` and `Add package from git URL...`
* Paste `https://github.com/KrystofSuk/com.unitysnippets.core.git`
* Use it :v: 

## Wiki

You can find more about the individual scripts and how to use them in **Wiki** tab.
